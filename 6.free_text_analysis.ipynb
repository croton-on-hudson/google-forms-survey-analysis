The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time.

Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area.

For example, so building facades can be brought back to the street and parking can be tucked behind, etc. (Hey, this begs the question where are COH's zoning codes regarding bikes, peds, parking, mixed use, etc?

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village.

I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",

I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village.

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

For example, so building facades can be brought back to the street and parking can be tucked behind, etc. (Hey, this begs the question where are COH's zoning codes regarding bikes, peds, parking, mixed use, etc?

       "* Final comments: The goal is to build/ amend infrastructure to enable not just safer, but more efficient travel, using less gas (environment) and still allowing for our small town enjoyment.  If we want to build up Croton for more business revenue (also property tax revenue) and for more business transactions to take place (versus travelling to Mohegan Lake for Walmart, Mt. Kisco for Target) in town, then let's design our transportation paths to stay on the perimeter of town.  The parking garage would be helpful for that.  People could park there and take an underpass to the stores in the Shop Rite shopping center and/or walk to the other businesses in the Harmon area."

Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village.

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

DOW site at Municipal Place is an eyesore. Get rid of it. If I was thinking of moving to Croton and saw the lack of upkeep in this town, esp. with our tax rate, I wouldn’t move here. DPW leaves garbage cans and recycling bins in the street which is a driving hazard as you have to drive around them which is difficult to navigate on a narrow road with oncoming traffic. \n",

When wet, very hazardous to drive, huge piles leads to lack of parking spaces on side streets and also more cars parking further out into the roadway(where you would drive). The huge piles of leaves also makes it difficult to walk on sidewalks as they fall onto the part you’d walk on. Very difficult for a baby carriage or wheelchair to get through and I worry about the elderly slipping and falling. Also, after a snowfall, crosswalks and corners on side streets are rarely shoveled, again, impossible for the elderly, baby strollers or the handicapped to get across. \n",

Too many cyclists not stopping at stop signs, no helmets, coming up on the left side(driver side) of the car and the cutting to the right in front of you, lack of hand/turn signals, people riding 2 and 3 abreast. Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",

The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",

Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

The issue is the pathways to walk there are visually unappealing specifically Brook Street & Riverside Ave. The area is neglected. Sidewalks are narrow, crumbling and dirty. The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Between the parking and speeding it is amazing people don’t get hurt. PS. These parents even honk at garbage trucks to get out of the way. \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site.

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below). \n",

This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

Lack of sidewalks and street lighting, lack of respect for pedestrian right-of-way, general disregard for safety, and utter lack of police monitoring of traffic at train station makes walking along Croton Point Avenue dangerous. I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

DOW site at Municipal Place is an eyesore. Get rid of it. If I was thinking of moving to Croton and saw the lack of upkeep in this town, esp. with our tax rate, I wouldn’t move here.

The huge piles of leaves also makes it difficult to walk on sidewalks as they fall onto the part you’d walk on. Very difficult for a baby carriage or wheelchair to get through and I worry about the elderly slipping and falling.

Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

As for the roadways, especially on N Riverside, there are no marked crosswalks for pedestrians, and doubly so when crossing NY-9A. It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below). \n",
       "* Problem areas: The entire village's sidewalks could use at least an inspection, and several sidewalks need immediate replacement. Van Wyck-Riverside Walking connection is recommended to reduce the need for car traffic in that area from local residents (and encourage walking to the connection), and maps of the surrounding trail systems (with GPS precision) NEED to be created on platforms (i.e. Open Street Map) and maintained, as this would greatly improve availability and navigability of Croton on trail systems and bike paths. This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

       "* Final comments: I have several suggestions to improve the village, and a good way to determine the problem locations includes accurate maps available to the community as a whole (OpenStreetMap is perfect for this application, as it now provides all sorts of data to be included) and also helps to determine who would most be potentially impacted by such changes. Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

I feel that people parking on the sidewalk should be ticketed, including people that leave their cars hanging out of their driveways onto the sidewalk.  I feel we should ask the Croton government to drop the speed limit to 20 mph (Twenty is plenty) Most of these streets are much smaller than Benedict and Cleveland and those streets are now is 25 mph.  Also it is nearly impossible to walk around croton when there is snow on the ground.

As for the roadways, especially on N Riverside, there are no marked crosswalks for pedestrians, and doubly so when crossing NY-9A. It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below). \n",

Van Wyck-Riverside Walking connection is recommended to reduce the need for car traffic in that area from local residents (and encourage walking to the connection), and maps of the surrounding trail systems (with GPS precision) NEED to be created on platforms (i.e. Open Street Map) and maintained, as this would greatly improve availability and navigability of Croton on trail systems and bike paths. This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Kisco for Target) in town, then let's design our transportation paths to stay on the perimeter of town.  The parking garage would be helpful for that.  People could park there and take an underpass to the stores in the Shop Rite shopping center and/or walk to the other businesses in the Harmon area."

       "* Feelings:  Croton Landing & the Riverwalk are amazing locations to see and walk or bike. Clearly there was lots of time and money spent on making these locations enjoyable for all. The issue is the pathways to walk there are visually unappealing specifically Brook Street & Riverside Ave. The area is neglected. Sidewalks are narrow, crumbling and dirty. The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Drivers often drive through the crosswalk there because the area is not well lit at night. Even during the day that specific crosswalk is extremely dangerous. Many cars do not fully stop at the stop sign and drive into the crosswalk. Pedestrians are not given the right of way in that crosswalk.  \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

The issue is the pathways to walk there are visually unappealing specifically Brook Street & Riverside Ave. The area is neglected. Sidewalks are narrow, crumbling and dirty. The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Lack of sidewalks and street lighting, lack of respect for pedestrian right-of-way, general disregard for safety, and utter lack of police monitoring of traffic at train station makes walking along Croton Point Avenue dangerous. I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",

The issue is the pathways to walk there are visually unappealing specifically Brook Street & Riverside Ave. The area is neglected. Sidewalks are narrow, crumbling and dirty. The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

DOW site at Municipal Place is an eyesore. Get rid of it. If I was thinking of moving to Croton and saw the lack of upkeep in this town, esp. with our tax rate, I wouldn’t move here.

When wet, very hazardous to drive, huge piles leads to lack of parking spaces on side streets and also more cars parking further out into the roadway(where you would drive). The huge piles of leaves also makes it difficult to walk on sidewalks as they fall onto the part you’d walk on. Very difficult for a baby carriage or wheelchair to get through and I worry about the elderly slipping and falling. Also, after a snowfall, crosswalks and corners on side streets are rarely shoveled, again, impossible for the elderly, baby strollers or the handicapped to get across. \n",

Too many cyclists not stopping at stop signs, no helmets, coming up on the left side(driver side) of the car and the cutting to the right in front of you, lack of hand/turn signals, people riding 2 and 3 abreast. Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

They rarely have teeth when it comes to implementation or $ but they do provide something to generate support for and track progress of administrations against. \n",
       "* Additional comments: Thanks for volunteering! I appreciate your efforts.  It takes time and persistence.  Case studies across the nation indicate that this work typically starts slowly.  A decade of stalling improvements to the train station, for example.  Once a few changes are built, people start appreciating it and it gets easier. \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

DOW site at Municipal Place is an eyesore. Get rid of it. If I was thinking of moving to Croton and saw the lack of upkeep in this town, esp. with our tax rate, I wouldn’t move here. DPW leaves garbage cans and recycling bins in the street which is a driving hazard as you have to drive around them which is difficult to navigate on a narrow road with oncoming traffic. \n",

When wet, very hazardous to drive, huge piles leads to lack of parking spaces on side streets and also more cars parking further out into the roadway(where you would drive). The huge piles of leaves also makes it difficult to walk on sidewalks as they fall onto the part you’d walk on. Very difficult for a baby carriage or wheelchair to get through and I worry about the elderly slipping and falling. Also, after a snowfall, crosswalks and corners on side streets are rarely shoveled, again, impossible for the elderly, baby strollers or the handicapped to get across. \n",

Too many cyclists not stopping at stop signs, no helmets, coming up on the left side(driver side) of the car and the cutting to the right in front of you, lack of hand/turn signals, people riding 2 and 3 abreast. Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

Walking on the sidewalk anywhere in the Village is risky — there is no enforcement by police of speed limits, stop sign laws, or pedestrian right-of-way, and poorly trained school crossing guards make walking in the village potentially DEADLY for children, and dangerous for adults.  \n",
       "* Problem areas: Lack of sidewalks and lack of respect for pedestrian right-of-way on signed crosswalks throughout the village, particularly on routes to CET and PVC, makes walking to school unsafe for our children. Lack of sidewalks and street lighting, lack of respect for pedestrian right-of-way, general disregard for safety, and utter lack of police monitoring of traffic at train station makes walking along Croton Point Avenue dangerous. I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",
       "* Suggestions: Speed limit and traffic law enforcement by Croton PD with aggressive ticketing and fines. Improved sidewalks, lighting, and raised crosswalks. (I’ve been told speed humps are challenging for plows, but similar traffic calming measures are needed.)  \n",
       "* Additional comments: We need pedestrian lanes (i.e., functional and safe sidewalks) just as much as we need bike lanes in Croton. The messaging from the BPC up to now has suggested a greater focus on bicycle safety than pedestrian safety, so I appreciate that pedestrians are getting equal consideration in this survey.  \n",

Please consider working with the school board and district more closely on safety issues as they relate to children in the community. The number of “near misses” isn’t tracked in the way accidents and fatalities are, and as a result we don’t seem to be taking these situations seriously as a community. "

I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",

There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",

Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village.

The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

DOW site at Municipal Place is an eyesore. Get rid of it. If I was thinking of moving to Croton and saw the lack of upkeep in this town, esp. with our tax rate, I wouldn’t move here. DPW leaves garbage cans and recycling bins in the street which is a driving hazard as you have to drive around them which is difficult to navigate on a narrow road with oncoming traffic. \n",

       "* Additional comments: Leaf collection in fall either needs to be bagged or more frequent vacuuming. When wet, very hazardous to drive, huge piles leads to lack of parking spaces on side streets and also more cars parking further out into the roadway(where you would drive). The huge piles of leaves also makes it difficult to walk on sidewalks as they fall onto the part you’d walk on. Very difficult for a baby carriage or wheelchair to get through and I worry about the elderly slipping and falling. Also, after a snowfall, crosswalks and corners on side streets are rarely shoveled, again, impossible for the elderly, baby strollers or the handicapped to get across. \n",

       "* Final comments: If you are going to have bike lanes, bicyclists must obey all traffic laws and that must be enforced for their safety, pedestrian and driver safety too. Too many cyclists not stopping at stop signs, no helmets, coming up on the left side(driver side) of the car and the cutting to the right in front of you, lack of hand/turn signals, people riding 2 and 3 abreast. Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

Kisco for Target) in town, then let's design our transportation paths to stay on the perimeter of town.  The parking garage would be helpful for that.

The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

The issue is the pathways to walk there are visually unappealing specifically Brook Street & Riverside Ave. The area is neglected. Sidewalks are narrow, crumbling and dirty. The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront.  \n",

Improve sidewalk access and safety for pedestrians, elderly, and handicapped, including adequate width and trimming of overgrown bushes that encroach on sidewalk space, improve visibility for motorists at intersections by enforcing codes on height of bushes, fences, etc."

As for the roadways, especially on N Riverside, there are no marked crosswalks for pedestrians, and doubly so when crossing NY-9A. It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below). \n",

Van Wyck-Riverside Walking connection is recommended to reduce the need for car traffic in that area from local residents (and encourage walking to the connection), and maps of the surrounding trail systems (with GPS precision) NEED to be created on platforms (i.e. Open Street Map) and maintained, as this would greatly improve availability and navigability of Croton on trail systems and bike paths. This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",
       "* Suggestions: Speed limit and traffic law enforcement by Croton PD with aggressive ticketing and fines. Improved sidewalks, lighting, and raised crosswalks. (I’ve been told speed humps are challenging for plows, but similar traffic calming measures are needed.)  \n",
       "* Additional comments: We need pedestrian lanes (i.e., functional and safe sidewalks) just as much as we need bike lanes in Croton. The messaging from the BPC up to now has suggested a greater focus on bicycle safety than pedestrian safety, so I appreciate that pedestrians are getting equal consideration in this survey.  \n",
       "* Business owner comments: none \n",
       "* Final comments: Thank you for taking the initiative to get community feedback. Please consider working with the school board and district more closely on safety issues as they relate to children in the community. The number of “near misses” isn’t tracked in the way accidents and fatalities are, and as a result we don’t seem to be taking these situations seriously as a community. "

The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time.

Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up.

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",

There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

As for the roadways, especially on N Riverside, there are no marked crosswalks for pedestrians, and doubly so when crossing NY-9A. It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below). \n",

Van Wyck-Riverside Walking connection is recommended to reduce the need for car traffic in that area from local residents (and encourage walking to the connection), and maps of the surrounding trail systems (with GPS precision) NEED to be created on platforms (i.e. Open Street Map) and maintained, as this would greatly improve availability and navigability of Croton on trail systems and bike paths. This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site.

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",
       "* Problem areas: See comment above. There are random gaps in the walking paths. There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",
       "* Suggestions: The five ways intersection is as complete mess and the traffic guard makes it worse in the mornings when school is in. Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.  \n",

       "* Feelings: One reason we chose to move here was it is one of the few towns in Westchester that has sidewalks. So that is a huge positive. However I've discovered while trying to walk around the neighborhood that the sidewalks lack connectivity - they randomly run out, so then you have to cross the road when it may not be a safe place to cross. There are also random sections where the tree roots have lifted the cement and made it unsafe. The first time I tried to walk to ShopRite (as I walked to get groceries in the City so was hoping to do the same here), I got to the traffic lights, and the sidewalk ran out. On the left are the donation bins, but no path. On the right is an undefined area - is it safe to walk or is it for cars? Then I walked down the ramp, not realising it's not for pedestrians as I didn't see the no pedestrian sign. I tried to walk to the diner and Duck Pond. Same thing - the sidewalk randomly runs out in Harmon so you have to cross the road or walk in the parking lanes. Having worked in transit planning, a first suggestion would be to do a survey of \"walking paths\" and find out where the gaps are, then look at fixing the most heavily used (or potentially heavily used) ones. The inconsistency makes it looks like it is a property owners responsibility to put in a sidewalk? Perhaps the Village has some spare funds to encourage owners to fill in the sidewalk gaps. \n",

There are also areas where the pavement has risen from tree routes or is impossible to push a stroller on. eg sections of Benedict Blvd, the road up to Sunset Park (Morningside Drive), Cleveland Ave and Olcott near the crossing if you want to come down the hill. \n",

Visibility is terrible and I've had many near misses where cars haven't stopped. My husband has driven through it not seeing the stop sign, and I have stopped a couple of times and missed a car already stopped because the visibility is bad. On school mornings, I'm sure the crossing guard is trying to do his job, but he goes out into the middle of it, waves his sign and throws his hands up in the air, confusing drivers even further. I also don't understand why the children are allowed to cross here NOT on the crosswalk - if there is a crossing guard he should be in the crosswalk directing the children to cross in the crosswalks. I also think a lot of people drive way too fast for the small roads here - the speed limits are clearly posted and the roads are narrow but I don't know how you address this.  \n",

It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below). \n",

This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place. \n",

Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area."

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site. Unfortunately, that is not a permanent solution, a change to the infrastructure is needed.  \n",

Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village.
