## Product roadmap
There are a few known areas of improvement on our roadmap:
- Automatic import from Google Forms, rather than manual export of CSV data
- Allow `free_text_tagging.ipynb` to automatically detect whether this is the first time the notebook has been run, and do the necessary csv file copying.
- Make a simple settings file where users can manage the string literals used for cleanup search/replace operations as well as which fields are used for breaking down the results in the analysis programs.
- Create a bash script that runs all programs in sequence and outputs the results as a single csv file, cleaning up the intermediate .csv files.
- Automate testing
