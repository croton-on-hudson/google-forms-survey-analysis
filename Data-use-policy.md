## Our Data Use Policy
Through your computer, mobile phone, and other digital devices, you leave behind hundreds of digital traces or data: bits of information about you that are created, stored, and collected.

We believe it is crucial for users to understand what data is being collected about them.

## This is not a “Privacy Policy”
Many websites link to their "privacy policies" from their homepages, but what they actually tell you is how they plan to use your data. We believe that it is important to be transparent that this policy is a promise about how we will use the data you leave when you complete this survey, but neither this promise nor the promise of any other site gives you full privacy.

The Data Use Policy is a compulsory legal disclosure of how a website operator collects, retains and shares personally-identifying information. In other words, it’s often a list of ways your personal data is not private and under their control. There are legitimate reasons that people and organizations running websites or online surveys need to keep the data you enter and data about your visits. We limit the data that we keep to only what we need for maintaining and analyzing the survey.

## Who are we?
The Great 2019 Croton-on-Hudson Transportation Survey is written and operated by The Bicycle Pedestrian Committee, a group of volunteer residents of Croton-on-Hudson.  We work with with the village government regarding issues of importance to the bicycle & pedestrian community.  In transparency, our membership changes over time, with a core group who meet on a regular basis, as well as others who periodically join or leave the group.

## What do we do with your data?
We ask residents to complete this survey and we collect this data in order to understand specific issues of importance to pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of any other non-motorized transportation in the village of Croton-on-Hudson.  This helps us to track trends, to understand what is working well in village transportation, to identify areas of interest for further discussion, as well as to determine what problems exist each mode of transportation within our village.

Our survey does not require you to submit any personally-identifying information, however you may voluntarily choose to do so.  If so, we will not rent or sell any personally-identifying information to anyone. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Where possible, we aim to provide you with a fully functioning survey — even if you do not supply personally-identifying information as part of the survey.

We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of personally-identifying information.

## What data do we collect when you visit and complete The Great 2019 Croton-on-Hudson Transportation Survey?

The survey is hosted using Google technology, including Google Forms and Google Sheets.  Thus, Google's [Privacy Policy and Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com) govern how Google collects, maintains, and uses your data.  In this way, our survey is similar to any other Google-operated service such as Gmail in terms of how Google uses your data.

Our committee members will be able to view your full responses to this survey, including such potential personally-identifying information as:
- your name, email address, and phone number (if you voluntarily choose to supply them)
- any other information you voluntarily provide us that may be used to directly or indirectly to identify you, such as the neighborhood you live in, reports you provide us of accidents you have been involved with, etc.

Besides our committee members, we will share aggregated data of survey responses with the Croton-on-Hudson village government as well as other interested residents of the community and the public at large.  This aggregated data will include statistics involving responses, as well as select quotes from freeform text responses by individual respondents that we believe are representative of the population at large.  However, we will make all reasonable efforts to not include personally-identifying information in those aggregated statistics and freeform text respones we share outside of our committee, and we will avoid including information that we believe may be indirectly used to identify an individual.

## How can I access and edit my survey responses
Since we do not require respondents to submit any personally-identifying information, we will not know who you are nor how to get in contact with you.  Please contact us directly in order to discuss accessing or editing your survey responses.  Our contact information is at the bottom of this document.

## How can I have my survey responses deleted?
Any respondents wishing to have their responses removed and deleted from our data set should contact us.  See below for our contact information.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change The Great Croton-on-Hudson Transportation Survey's Data Use Policy from time to time, in response to legal and technical changes and at our discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to this Data Use Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Data Use Policy constitutes your acceptance of these change.
